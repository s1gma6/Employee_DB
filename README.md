# Employee_DB
A simple system level implementation of a database containing employee information purely using python

Purely uses classes and object oriented programming with python to store employee data using objects.

Going to work on a proper front end either through a website or through a C++ app to implement dektop
and or web level application.

Hopeful of using MongoDB or other database management systems like MySQL along with a front-end hopefully
coded using Django. 

The idea is simple:

  -Get the employees' data
  
  -Store it in objects which can be further manipulated into databases
  
  -Work on a front-end application using Flask or Django
  
  -Implement Back-End development more than front-end development
  
  -Use inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism
  
  -Used for storing company's data
